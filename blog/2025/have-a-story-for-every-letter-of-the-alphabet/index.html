<p class="meta"><small>August 28, 2025</small></p>

<p>Years and years ago I saw this piece of advice, but for the life of me I cannot remember where I found it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Nor really can I recall if there was more to it than what follows, but I do think it’s an incredibly useful bit of advice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have an anecdote or story to share for every letter of the alphabet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasoning should be readily apparent. By preparing twenty-six anecdotes, you have a trove of tales to share with anyone you meet. Keeping them varied and on a broad range of subjects means that you are able to contribute a witty tale or appropriate story to most any situation.</p>

<p>To go further; there’s a scene in Reservoir Dogs where the undercover cop is being taught about how to lie convincingly. His superior tells him that to make a story convincing you must know every detail and deliver it casually. Learn the story perfectly to be able to tell it imperfectly.</p>

<p>You can apply this for yourself as well. The catch is that you’re not learning to deliver a monologue. You need to refine the story each time we tell it so as to learn to tell it better next time. What was a useful detail to leave in, what could you have left out, where did you start losing the audience? Those sorts of things.</p>

<p>Two important things to remember:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It will take time to accumulate your stories. Don’t wait until you have all twenty-six stories to start socialising. You need to do some living to even generate these anecdotes!</li>
  <li>This is not a cure for anxiety or difficulty felt around socialising. Having stories prepped will not be much or any help if/when your brain fogs up.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, there is perhaps a little irony to the fact that the first of these rules that I am posting is one where I have not taken my own advice. I have three, maybe four of these stories in my head. I do intend to polish and post them as blogs eventually, and indeed one letter’s story is already available at time of this writing: <a href="/blog/2025/a-very-flirtatious-neighbour/">N</a>. Eventually™ all of them will be online, and a nice little list is available <a href="/tag/alphabet-anecdotes/">here</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Some Day™ I’ll probably write up a rant about living in an age of information saturation, where it’s increasingly difficult to find what you’re looking for. But that is not today. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
