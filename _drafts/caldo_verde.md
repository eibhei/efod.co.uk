# Preamble


# Ingredients
2-3 chorizo rings, at least one with spiciness; chopped into bitesize pieces
2-3 large potatoes
1 large onion, diced
8 cloves of garlic, minced (or use 2-3 bricks of frozen paste)
big bunch of kale
chicken stock
apple cider vinegar
salt & pepper to taste

cumin
chili powder
smoked paprika
oregano
lime juice

fresh coriander

## Method
1. Chop chorizo, half into small pieces, half into larger chunks
2. Heat a little olive oil in a large pan, and fry the small pieces until browned and starting to crisp
3. Remove with a slotted spoon and store in a bowl
4. Repeat 2-3 with the larger pieces, storing in a separate bowl
5. There should be a good amount of oil in the pan from the chorizo, so spoon some out and save it for later. Add some more olive oil. 
6. Begin frying the onions in the oil over a medium-high heat.  Add a pinch of salt to help them release their moisture. Stir regularly to ensure nothing burns to the bottom of the pan
7. Add the garlic paste and cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, and oregano. Keep frying until the onions are good and soft. Add the vinegar and cook until the smell isn't so strong
8. Add the potatoes and saute a little, ensuring that they're nicely incorporated
9. Pour over the chicken stock and add any water if needed. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes just until the potatoes are soft.
10. Shred half of the kale and add that into the mixture until wilted. Stir through the small chunks of chorizo.
11. Transfer ingredients to a blender (or use a hand one) and blitz until thick and creamy
12. Transfer back to the pan and continue to simmer the soup, topping up with water if the consistency is too thick to your liking.
13. Roughly chop the remaining kale, and transfer that in, allowing it to wilt.
14. Add the lime juice and fresh coriander, and 3/4 of the remaining chorizo pieces
15. Simmer over low heat until ready to eat, adding salt and pepper as appropriate
16. To serve, ladel a portion into a bowl, place a small bit of coriander on top in the middle, and use that as a bed to place a few extra chorizo pieces.
17. Serve with tortilla chips and lemon wedges.
