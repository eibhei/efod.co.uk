## Preamble
I discovered this recipe for caldo verde on Instagram thanks to B-. I note that the end product of that video was not at all green, and the finished product of this recipe isn't all that green either. However, it's become known as caldo verde in our house because it's easier (and fancier) to say than chorizo, potato, and kale soup. It's a lovely winter warmer, and can be made with quite the kick if you like one.

## Ingredients
Olive oil
2-3 chorizo rings
2-3 large potatoes
1 large onion
2-3 bricks of frozen garlic paste
big bunch of kale
apple cider vinegar
salt & pepper to taste
cumin
chili powder (optional)
smoked paprika
oregano
lime juice
fresh coriander

## Prep
- Chop the chorizo into two sizes: small and large. The smaller chunks will be blended, and the large will go into the finished soup
- Dice the onions. We'll be blending the soup, so it doesn't matter if they're larger. They cook faster if they're small though
- Wash the potatoes, but don't peel them.
- Shred all the kale into bitesize pieces; half is going to be blended so it doesn't need to be neat

## Method
1. Chop chorizo, half into small pieces, half into larger chunks
2. In a pan large enough for the finished soup, heat a good glug of olive oil, and fry the small chunks of chorizo until browned and starting to crisp
3. Remove with a slotted spoon and store in a bowl
4. Repeat 2-3 with the larger pieces, storing in a separate bowl
5. There should be a good amount of oil in the pan from the chorizo, so spoon some out and save it for later. Add some more olive oil. 
6. Begin frying the onions in the oil over a medium-high heat.  Add a pinch of salt to help them release their moisture. Stir regularly to ensure nothing burns to the bottom of the pan
7. Add the garlic paste and cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, and oregano. Keep frying until the onions are good and soft. Add the vinegar and cook until the smell isn't so strong
8. Add the potatoes and saute a little, ensuring that they're nicely incorporated
9. Pour over the chicken stock and add any water if needed. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes just until the potatoes are soft.
10. Shred half of the kale and add that into the mixture until wilted. Stir through the small chunks of chorizo.
11. Transfer ingredients to a blender (or use a hand one) and blitz until thick and creamy
12. Transfer back to the pan and continue to simmer the soup, topping up with water if the consistency is too thick to your liking.
13. Roughly chop the remaining kale, and transfer that in, allowing it to wilt.
14. Add the lime juice and fresh coriander, and 3/4 of the remaining chorizo pieces
15. Simmer over low heat until ready to eat, adding salt and pepper as appropriate
16. To serve, ladel a portion into a bowl, place a small bit of coriander on top in the middle, and use that as a bed to place a few extra chorizo pieces. For classy presentation, drizzle some of that chorizo oil around the bowl
17. Serve with tortilla chips and lemon wedges.
